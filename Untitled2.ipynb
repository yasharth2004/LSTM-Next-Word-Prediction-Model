        "To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\n",
        "mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\n",
        "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\n",
        "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\n",
        "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\n",
        "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\n",
        "the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\n",
        "false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\n",
        "and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\n",
        "drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\n",
        "reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\n",
        "adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\n",
        "throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\n",
        "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\n",
        "be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\n",
        "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\n",
        "Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n",
        "from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n",
        "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n",
        "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n",
        "while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\n",
        "soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\n",
        "books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\n",
        "the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
        "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\n",
        "and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\n",
        "observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n",
        "mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n",
        "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\n",
        "summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\n",
        "of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\n",
        "finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\n",
        "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n",
        "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
        "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\n",
        "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\n",
        "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n",
        "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\n",
        "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\n",
        "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\n",
        "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n",
        "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n",
        "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n",
        "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n",
        "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n",
        "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n",
        "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n",
        "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
        "\n",
        "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
        "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n",
        "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n",
        "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n",
        "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\n",
        "on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Seven!” I answered.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
        "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\n",
        "that you intended to go into harness.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, how do you know?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n",
        "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\n",
        "servant girl?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\n",
        "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n",
        "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
        "have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
        "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\n",
        "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\n",
        "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\n",
        "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
        "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\n",
        "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\n",
        "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\n",
        "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n",
        "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\n",
        "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\n",
        "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\n",
        "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\n",
        "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n",
        "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
        "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\n",
        "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\n",
        "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n",
        "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
        "down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\n",
        "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
        "which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Frequently.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How often?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then how many are there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How many? I don’t know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n",
        "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
        "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\n",
        "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\n",
        "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\n",
        "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\n",
        "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\n",
        "said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\n",
        "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\n",
        "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n",
        "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
        "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n",
        "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\n",
        "wear a mask.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\n",
        "means?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
        "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
        "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n",
        "it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
        "written.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
        "endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\n",
        "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
        "stiff.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\n",
        "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\n",
        "with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\n",
        "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\n",
        "our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
        "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
        "from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
        "German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\n",
        "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\n",
        "glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\n",
        "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\n",
        "from his cigarette.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
        "peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\n",
        "all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\n",
        "that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
        "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\n",
        "writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\n",
        "face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\n",
        "doubts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\n",
        "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\n",
        "whistled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\n",
        "the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\n",
        "and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\n",
        "is nothing else.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\n",
        "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But your client—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\n",
        "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\n",
        "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\n",
        "authoritative tap.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Come in!” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\n",
        "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\n",
        "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\n",
        "taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\n",
        "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\n",
        "thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\n",
        "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\n",
        "beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\n",
        "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\n",
        "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\n",
        "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\n",
        "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
        "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\n",
        "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\n",
        "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\n",
        "and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\n",
        "of obstinacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\n",
        "marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\n",
        "one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\n",
        "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\n",
        "have I the honour to address?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\n",
        "understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\n",
        "discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\n",
        "importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\n",
        "alone.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\n",
        "my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\n",
        "gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\n",
        "“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\n",
        "that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\n",
        "much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\n",
        "European history.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I promise,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\n",
        "person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\n",
        "confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\n",
        "not exactly my own.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\n",
        "be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\n",
        "seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\n",
        "plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\n",
        "kings of Bohemia.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\n",
        "his armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\n",
        "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\n",
        "most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\n",
        "slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\n",
        "should be better able to advise you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\n",
        "uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\n",
        "the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”\n",
        "he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\n",

        "the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\n",
        "and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\n",
        "open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\n",

        "Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\n",
        "out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\n",
        "goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\n",
        "visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\n",
        "never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\n",

        "\n",
        "“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\n",

        "his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\n",
        "transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\n",
        "likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\n",
        "continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\n",
        "gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\n",
        "widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\n",

        "I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\n",
        "to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\n",

        "excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\n",

        "appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\n",

        "much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\n",
        "of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\n",
        "seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And what then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\n",
        "There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\n",
        "come what may. You understand?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am to be neutral?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\n",
        "unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\n",
        "into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\n",
        "will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\n",
        "you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\n",
        "quite follow me?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Entirely.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\n",
        "roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted\n",
        "with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\n",
        "confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\n",
        "by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\n",
        "street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\n",
        "myself clear?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\n",
        "the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\n",
        "to wait you at the corner of the street.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Precisely.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\n",
        "for the new role I have to play.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\n",
        "character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\n",
        "broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\n",
        "smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\n",
        "as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\n",
        "Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\n",
        "seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\n",
        "fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\n",
        "specialist in crime.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\n",
        "wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\n",
        "Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\n",
        "we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\n",
        "of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\n",
        "less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\n",
        "quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\n",
        "shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\n",
        "scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\n",
        "nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\n",
        "down with cigars in their mouths.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\n",
        "house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\n",
        "a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\n",
        "to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\n",
        "to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\n",
        "the photograph?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where, indeed?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\n",
        "size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n",
        "that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\n",
        "attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\n",
        "she does not carry it about with her.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\n",
        "inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\n",
        "to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\n",
        "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\n",
        "indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\n",
        "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\n",
        "a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\n",
        "in her own house.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But it has twice been burgled.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But how will you look?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will not look.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“What then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will get her to show me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But she will refuse.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\n",
        "carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\n",
        "curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\n",
        "the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\n",
        "the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\n",
        "copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\n",
        "the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\n",
        "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\n",
        "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\n",
        "struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\n",
        "was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\n",
        "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\n",
        "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\n",
        "he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\n",
        "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\n",
        "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\n",
        "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\n",
        "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\n",
        "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\n",
        "stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\n",
        "the hall, looking back into the street.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He is dead,” cried several voices.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\n",
        "before you can get him to hospital.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\n",
        "purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\n",
        "rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\n",
        "This way, please!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\n",
        "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\n",
        "the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\n",
        "so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\n",
        "whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\n",
        "was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\n",
        "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\n",
        "was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\n",
        "the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\n",
        "to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\n",
        "my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\n",
        "thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\n",
        "injuring another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\n",
        "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\n",
        "the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\n",
        "rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\n",
        "of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\n",
        "ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\n",
        "“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\n",
        "open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\n",
        "the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\n",
        "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\n",
        "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\n",
        "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\n",
        "and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\n",
        "quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\n",
        "better. It is all right.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have the photograph?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I know where it is.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And how did you find out?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am still in the dark.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\n",
        "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\n",
        "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I guessed as much.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\n",
        "palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\n",
        "face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That also I could fathom.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\n",
        "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\n",
        "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\n",
        "see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\n",
        "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How did that help you?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\n",
        "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\n",
        "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\n",
        "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\n",
        "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\n",
        "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\n",
        "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\n",
        "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\n",
        "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\n",
        "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\n",
        "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\n",
        "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\n",
        "she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\n",
        "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\n",
        "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\n",
        "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\n",
        "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\n",
        "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And now?” I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\n",
        "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\n",
        "into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\n",
        "when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\n",
        "a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And when will you call?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\n",
        "clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\n",
        "complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\n",
        "delay.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\n",
        "searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\n",
        "appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\n",
        "street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\n",

        "\n",
        "III.\n",

        "room.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\n",

        "\n",
        "“No, my brougham is waiting.”\n",
        "\n",

        "“Yesterday.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\n",

        "\n",
        "“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\n",
        "What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\n",
        "which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\n",
        "steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\n",

        "\n",
        "“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\n",
        "\n",

        "the Continent.”\n",
        "\n",

        "Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\n",
        "plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\n",
        "photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\n",
        "superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\n",
        "friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\n",
        "midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\n",
        "\n",
        "    “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\n",
        "    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\n",
        "    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\n",
        "    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\n",
        "    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\n",
        "    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\n",
        "    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\n",
        "    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\n",
        "    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\n",
        "    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\n",
        "    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\n",
        "    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\n",
        "    down just as you departed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\n",
        "    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\n",
        "    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\n",

        "you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League\n",

        "peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great\n",

        "many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\n",
        "would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed\n",
        "and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\n",
        "to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon\n",

        "disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\n",
        "matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much\n",
        "more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\n",

        "all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\n",
        "walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\n",
        "looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,\n",
        "and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\n",
        "three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\n",

        "remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\n",

        "\n",
        "“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\n",

        "it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\n",
        "an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\n",
        "is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\n",

        "\n",
        "We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\n",
        "ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\n",
        "guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\n",
        "through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\n",
        "corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\n",
        "opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\n",
        "at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\n",
        "lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\n",
        "so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\n",
        "piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n",

        "\n",
        "“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\n",
        "flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he\n",
        "remarked, looking up in surprise.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\n",

        "upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\n",
        "\n",
        "The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\n",
        "injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\n",
        "the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\n",
        "minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\n",
        "satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\n",
        "pocket.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly\n",
        "take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\n",
        "will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\n",
        "time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no\n",
        "doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\n",
        "principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\n",
        "and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\n",
        "criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\n",
        "at present.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\n",
        "warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your French gold?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\n",
        "borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\n",
        "has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\n",
        "and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\n",
        "contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\n",
        "reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\n",
        "single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\n",
        "subject.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\n",
        "that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\n",
        "will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\n",
        "screen over that dark lantern.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And sit in the dark?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\n",
        "thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber\n",
        "after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far\n",
        "that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\n",
        "choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\n",
        "them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\n",
        "I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\n",
        "those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\n",
        "fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\n",
        "which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\n",
        "and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never\n",
        "before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\n",
        "the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To\n",
        "me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\n",
        "something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\n",
        "dank air of the vault.\n",
        "\n",
        "“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through\n",
        "the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\n",
        "asked you, Jones?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\n",
        "wait.”\n",
        "\n",
        "What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\n",
        "hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\n",
        "almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\n",
        "stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\n",
        "to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\n",
        "could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\n",
        "distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\n",
        "thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\n",
        "over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\n",
        "the glint of a light.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\n",
        "lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\n",
        "warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\n",
        "almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\n",
        "of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\n",
        "protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\n",
        "appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\n",
        "marked a chink between the stones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\n",
        "sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\n",
        "left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\n",
        "lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\n",
        "looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\n",
        "aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\n",
        "rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\n",
        "hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\n",
        "himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags?\n",
        "Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\n",
        "The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\n",
        "as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\n",
        "revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\n",
        "the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at\n",
        "all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that\n",
        "my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\n",
        "compliment you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\n",
        "effective.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at\n",
        "climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\n",
        "prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be\n",
        "aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\n",
        "when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n",
        "\n",
        "“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you\n",
        "please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\n",
        "Highness to the police-station?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\n",
        "the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\n",
        "the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\n",
        "There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\n",
        "complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\n",
        "that have ever come within my experience.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\n",
        "Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\n",
        "matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\n",
        "amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\n",
        "and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\n",
        "sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly\n",
        "obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\n",
        "fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\n",
        "of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\n",
        "out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\n",
        "managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\n",
        "The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the\n",
        "colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must\n",
        "draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They\n",
